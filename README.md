# PyPassword Generator

The **PyPassword Generator** is a Python program that helps you create a secure and customizable password by letting you choose how many letters, symbols, and numbers you'd like in your password. The program then randomly generates a password based on your preferences.

## Features
- Customizable password length by selecting the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.
- Uses a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols for stronger password security.
- Randomly shuffles the characters to ensure unpredictability.

## How to Use
1. Run the program, and you will be prompted to enter:
   - The number of **letters** in your password.
   - The number of **symbols** in your password.
   - The number of **numbers** in your password.
2. The program will then generate a random password with the specified number of characters.
3. The password will be displayed at the end.

## Example
```bash
